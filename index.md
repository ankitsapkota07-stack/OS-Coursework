 # Project Overview:  
This project involved configuring, securing, and evaluating a headless Linux server in a virtualised environment. I carried out the work over seven weeks, covering system planning, security hardening, performance testing, and security auditing. The goal was to develop practical skills in Linux system administration, remote management, and security best practices while understanding the trade-offs between performance, security, and usability.  

# Key Themes:
Security Hardening
Performance Analysis
CLI Proficiency
Sustainability & Efficiency  

# Learning Outcomes Achieved
This coursework directly addresses the following module learning outcomes:  
LO3: Assess security vulnerabilities and threats within operating systems and apply appropriate security mechanisms and best practices to protect computer systems from potential exploits.  
LO4: Demonstrate proficiency in using command-line tools and system utilities to perform computer management tasks, including process monitoring, file system manipulation, and system configuration.  
LO5: Critically evaluate the limitations and trade-offs inherent in operating system design, synthesising knowledge of hardware constraints, performance considerations, and security requirements.

 # Key Findings & Reflections
Security Implementation  
Implemented 5 mandatory security controls: SSH key-based authentication, firewall configuration, user privilege management, mandatory access control (SELinux/AppArmor), and intrusion detection (fail2ban).  
Achieved a Lynis security score of 65/100 after systematic remediation.  
Successfully blocked unauthorized access attempts using firewall rules and fail2ban.  

 # Performance Insights
Optimised system performance by ~20% through kernel parameter tuning and service management.  
Identified I/O bottlenecks under heavy load using iotop and vmstat.  
Reduced idle CPU usage from 8% to 2% by disabling unnecessary services.
